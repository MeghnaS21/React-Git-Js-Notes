CAPSTONE PROJECT - TEAM(4)

  1)  6th sept  TO 10th/12th sept ---(Complete end product + styling)( in 5  days)
         
  2)  11/13  TO 14th (Preparing for presentation/pending work/PPT file)


PROBLEMS

1) How to collaborate/work in a team on same project with different developers? 


STRATEGY

1) Every team will develop all the features, but what will makes us different from other teams is  our UI.

2) Do not develop from scratch, otherwise UNIQUE FEATURES cannot be implemented? (Not mandatory)

3) Divide the problem statement as react components and work accordingly.

4) Common style throughout the development phase. - white bg & black text color

5) React best practices. Clean code. Semantic tags.

6) Divide the project (DAY- WISE)



RULES

1)  Do not share team strategies with other team members for the sake of  CAPSTONE PROJECT.

2)  Be open, share ideas either in chat window or by unmuting yourself.

3)  If you get stuck,do ask other members and don't hesitate. Because we have limited time, so being stuck in finding solution to a problem on our own for more than 2 hours will waste your precious time and productivity. 

4) Do not forget to take rest. :))
