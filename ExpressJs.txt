Difference betweeen vanilla js & react
vanilla js is base for every library and framewrok and react is a library

For server, we can use nodejs
nodejs is something like vanilla js, no flexible feature, we have to do it on our own
express js is like react
Express has it's own functionality like react to build server


many types of storage on client-->

Browser's storage :- 
1) local storage 2) session storage 3) cookie(less used today)

Meant for multiple purposes, just to remember, which user has logged in, not asking user everrytime user name and password. In short, one time authentications for a particular period of time. 

example-
1) open gmail
2) backend create token
3) five it to client
4) client hitting api-> you will be authorising the user using that token

difference between authorisation and authentication:-
    authorisation-> access with this token
   authentication-> check and send the key
For authorisation -> JWT 

Example-

1- login (using payload, we will send username and password) cleient to server
2- server is connected to mond=godb
3- server generates token
4-
